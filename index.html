					<div class="steps clearfix">
						<div class="numbers clearfix" id="one">
							<h1>-1-</h1>
							<h4>Employers Sign up </h4>
							<p>Sign up, select an annual benefit package, and choose between our monthly or annual payment options. Don’t worry about paying for services your employees don’t use! The value of any unused services at the end of the benefit year will be deducted from the cost of the benefit package you select for the following year.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="numbers clearfix" id="two">
							<h1>-2-</h1>
							<h4>Employees Sign up</h4>
							<p>Direct your employees visit to our website where they’ll create a profile and learn more about their new benefits!</p>
						</div>
						<div class="numbers clearfix" id="three">
							<h1>-3-</h1>
							<h4>Employees Access Care </h4>
							<p>Employees in need of care will visit our website, choose a provider they want to see, and walk-in or schedule an appointment. When your employee checks in for the visit, she (he) will redeem a virtual token, which will fully cover the cost of the services included in her (his) benefit package.</p>

					<h1>What We Do</h1>

We offer several benefit options and structure them so that you don’t pay for unused services. </p>

				<div class="info" id="whodoweserve">
					<h1>Who Do We Serve</h1>
